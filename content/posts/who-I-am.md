Hey, this is Plainpop. 
I earn money working as a scala backend developer but I am interested in a lot more tech.

I want to learn some new tech and write some tutorials, mostly for my future me,
 but maybe it will help some of you.

You will find here tutorials of customizations I am doing and new technologies I will be learning.

You can contact me in:
